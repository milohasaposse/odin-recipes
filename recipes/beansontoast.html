    <h1>Beans on Toast</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beans on toast is a very British lunch.  Only Heinz beans in tomato sauce may be used.</p>
    <p>Sir Patrick Stewart claims this is the only dish he is capable of preparing.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tin 13.7 oz (390 g) of Heinz beans (made in England)</li>
        <li>3 slices of bread</li>
        <li>pat of butter (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the beans into a small pot over medium low heat.</li>
        <li>Put the bread in the toaster, and make the toast as desired. (If you like, you can butter the toast, but I find it unecessary as the beans are the primary flavor.)</li>
        <li>Stir the beans, and heat until almost boiling, but don't allow to boil. (According to directions on the tin, this will affect the flavor.)</li>
        <li>Place the toast on plates, and spoon â…“ tin of the beans over the top of each slice. Serve immediately, preferably with a cup of hot tea.</li>
    </ol>
